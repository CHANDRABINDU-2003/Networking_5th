Develop a multicast chatting tool that will be used to communicate among a group of
processes. Each process should be able to send and receive any number of messages. The
chat tool should have the following functionalities:
1) Get the message from the user and send it to all the other processes belonging to
the group. A process can receive a copy of the message.
2) Read the messages sent by any other process and display the message to the user.
