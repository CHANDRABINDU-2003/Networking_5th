Develop an election vote casting application as follows: There are two candidates A and B
contesting an election. There are five electorates (processes) and each electorate can cast their
vote only once and for only one of the two candidates (A or B). The vote cast by an electorate
is a character ‘A’ or ‘B’, sent as a multicast message to all the other electorates. The winner
is the candidate who gets the maximum number of votes. After casting the vote and also
receiving the vote messages from all other electorates, each electorate should be able to
independently determine the winner and display it.
